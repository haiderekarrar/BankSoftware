## About

Your program should have a README file to allow people to fully understand what they're looking at. This file includes telling what the program does and why you made it (what purpose does it serve), how to interact with the software you made, a preview perhaps, features, how people can improve it if they wish to do so, etc etc. 
Documenting your code is important.
